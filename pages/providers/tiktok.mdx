This integration requires that you have a TikTok developer account. It also requires that you have a public website, with https, and can upload files to that site to verify ownership.

TikTok will also not allow http:// for your app redirect URI, so you will need to be accessing Postiz from HTTPS.

<Callout type="warning">
**NOTE:** TikTok fetches media via pull_from_url. Your media files must be publicly reachable over HTTPS; localhost or private routes (e.g., /uploads) will fail. 
Expose your uploads via a reverse proxy (e.g., [Caddy](/reverse-proxies/caddy/)) or use object storage/CDN such as [Cloudflare R2](/configuration/r2/) with public access.

Ensure the media domain is listed under your TikTok developer account’s verified sites.

This is a multi-step, multi-week process—there are no short‑cuts. Expect at least two weeks before publishing to your public TikTok account, and often longer depending on how the review goes.

1. Create a TikTok developer account and add a “demo” account inside it.
2. Build a sandbox app, use that sandbox to create a demonstrative video showing how your workflow operates, and only then create a production application.
3. Once the production app is complete and submitted, approval typically arrives within 24 hours; those credentials unlock publishing to your private/protected account.
4. After you publish with those credentials, you must explicitly request a review; it is extensive, and any mistakes can introduce major delays.

TikTok only grants API/app access for businesses that provide social media scheduling as a service. If you are requesting access for purely internal use, the request will be declined. Having a long-established domain, an HTTPS public website that clearly describes your public service, and matching Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages improves your chances—but there are still no guarantees.

<Steps>

### Create you app

Go here: https://developers.tiktok.com/apps

![Create a new app](./tiktok_create_app.png)

* **App Name:** `MyPostiz`
* **Redirect URI:** (see below)

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "tiktok" />

### Set a TOS and Privacy Policy

This needs to be on a public domain that you have access to, that is hosted on HTTPS. 

Tick "Web" for your platforms.

### Add apps

Add the "Login Kit" and "Content Posting API" to your app.

For "Login Kit", set the redirect URI to http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/tiktok

For Content posting API, enable "Direct Post".

### Add scopes

- user.info.basic
- video.publish
- video.upload
- user.info.profile

### Copy your client secret to environment variables

These can be found immediately after registering your application. The client ID is 16 characters long and the secret is 32 characters long.


```env
TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890123456
TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=12345678901234567890123456789012
```

Restart Postiz with the updated environment variables



### Add a TikTok channel in the Postiz web interface

Go to the Postiz web interface, and click on the "Add Channel" button. Select "TikTok" from the list of available channels. You should be redirected to TikTok to authorize the application.
